-	It is my assumption the products are cryptocurrency pairs data feeds. Assets like BTC/BNB, BTC/USD, BNB/USD and many others 

What is Quality and how do we measure it? 
-	The quality of a currency are things like liquidity, spread, market depth at various price points, lending rates, price volatility, availability of assets on different infrastructures.
